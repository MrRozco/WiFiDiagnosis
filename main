/* Class: CMSC203 CRN 46519
 Program: Assignment #1
 Instructor: Farnaz Eivazi
 Summary of Description: Build an application that will step through some possible problems
 to restore internet connectivity.  Assume that your computer uses wi-fi to connect to a router
  which connects to an Internet Service Provider (ISP) which connects to the Internet.
 Due Date: 06/21/2022 
 * Platform/compiler:Eclipse
 * I pledge that I have completed the programming assignment independently.
   I have not copied the code from a student or any source.
   I have not given my code to any student.
